# Build tools

## Documentation

The documentation of the build tools makes use of [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/).
You can install the needed dependencies by running `docs/install_dependencies.sh`
and build the documentation by running `docs/build_docs.sh`.
