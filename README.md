## How to develop?

Some commands are executed using sudo.
This requires allowing sudo w/o password which is a bad idea on your dev host.
To workaorund this, a dev container is used.

- Open the dev container.
- Setup Python venv and install required tools: `setup_workspace`
- Install extensions: `install_extensions`
