= The helper tools

The build tools provide also some helper tools, which are not directly 
used in the image build process. These tools are support tools for
developing images.

build_tools_core:: The Core Tool allows to install the required host
  dependency packages and apply the required host configuration using
  one command. It is used in the _Image Development_ devcontainer feature
  to setup the container.
package_downloader:: The package downloader allows to easy download and
  extract Debian packages form an apt repository. This may help during
  image development.
build_tools_proxy:: This will be an apt proxy and is not implemented at
  the moment.
