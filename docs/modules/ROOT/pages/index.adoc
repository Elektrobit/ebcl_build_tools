= The Build Tools

The build tools is a collection of Python scripts which allows to build
embedded Linux images from a given specification in a reproducible way,
as far as the installation of the selected packages and the image specific
configuration is reproducible.

Embedded systems can use quite complex architectures, and the "server-like"
images only using a bootloader which runs the kernel and mounts a single root
filesystem are more an edge case. The following picture gives an overview
about typical embedded system architectures.

The build tools want to support all of these architectures, and all kinds of
hardware, which requires a very flexible approach, since many SoCs come with
very special needs and maybe even vendor specific build and signing tools.
The build tools tackle this challenge by using a modular approach.
The kernel, the initrd.img, and the filesystems are considered separate
artifacts, using a separate build, which are integrated into an overall
image as a final build step.

Each of these artifacts and steps uses it's own specification, which allows
to work in different artifacts in parallel with different teams. These
specifications are _yaml_ files, and to avoid redundancy the yaml files
allow inheritance. The helper tools read these specifications and build
the different artifacts according to the specification, in a reproducible
way, as far is this is supported by the underlying tools and packages.
To fully automate the build of an ready to use image, these helper tools
can be chained together using https://taskfile.dev/[taskfile], a modern
make replacement. The integration of the different binary artifacts can
be done using https://github.com/Elektrobit/embdgen[embdgen], a `dd` on
steroids able to build a binary image from a _yaml_ specification and
given artifacts. Such a build flow for a QEMU image can look like:

The _root_generator_, the _root_configurator_, the _initrd_generator_ and
the _boot_generator_ are the helper tools provided in
https://github.com/GreyBeagleLinux/build_tools[this repository].
The image builder _embdgen_ is developer separately in
https://github.com/Elektrobit/embdgen[this repository].
The "green glue" is provided by https://taskfile.dev/[taskfile].
For this build flow, the _root_generator_ is not applying the
configuration. The configuration is applied in a second step
using the _root_configurator_. This has the advantage that
configuration changes doesnâ€™t require to run _debootstrap_ again,
which can be quite time consuming.
