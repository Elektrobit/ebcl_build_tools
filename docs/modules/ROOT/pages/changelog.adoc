== [1.3.5] - 2025-12-17

Forking off from https://github.com/Elektrobit/ebcl_build_tools[EBcL build tools].
The EBcL build tools are developed in lock step with
https://www.elektrobit.com/products/ecu/eb-corbos/linux-built-on-ubuntu/[Elektrobit corbos Linux],
and need to follow a strict development process. This fork is my "playground"
to try out new ideas, and build images for my BeagleBone SBCs.
